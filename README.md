# :oncoming_automobile: Road Accident Data Analysis and Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of road accident data, aimed at identifying patterns, trends, and insights related to road safety and accident occurrences. Using this data, an interactive dashboard has been developed to allow users to explore and visualize key aspects of the dataset effectively.

## Introduction

This project explores a dataset containing road accident records, with the goal of identifying critical factors that contribute to accident occurrences and suggesting potential safety measures. By analyzing patterns across various attributes (such as location, accident type, and time), this project helps stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance road safety.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: [`Road Accident Data.xlsx`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qVW3i4GrSYwWm_L-MFZt_hD4n7iKmMTY?usp=drive_link)
- **Dashboard File**: [`Road_Accident_Dashboard.pbix`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XkDg_Qxsmngy6e1EmOpNSC4PvnskYFkk/view?usp=drive_link) (created in Power BI)

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed information on road accidents, with columns such as:

- **Date**: Date of the accident
- **Location**: Accident location (e.g., city, region)
- **Accident Type**: Classification of the accident
- **Weather Conditions**: Conditions at the time of the accident
- **Casualties/Injuries**: Number of people affected
- **Severity**: Severity level of the accident
- **Vehicle Type**: Type of vehicle(s) involved
- **Additional Columns**: Measures providing more accident context

## Dashboard

The interactive Power BI dashboard provides visualizations to help users analyze the road accident data effectively. Key features include:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Trends of accidents over time
- **Location-Based Analysis**: Mapping of accident hotspots
- **Accident Severity Distribution**: Severity levels across different regions
- **Vehicle Type and Weather Analysis**: How various factors impact accident occurrences

## Analysis and Insights

This project explores several important insights:

1. **High-Risk Locations**: Areas with higher accident frequencies.
2. **Accident Peaks**: Specific times or weather conditions that correlate with increased accidents.
3. **Severity Analysis**: Types of accidents associated with higher severity levels.

## Future Work

Possible extensions of this project include:

- **Adding Predictive Analysis**: Using machine learning to predict accident-prone conditions.
- **Integrating Real-Time Data**: Utilizing real-time traffic and weather data for dynamic insights.
- **Expanding Dashboard**: Enhancing interactivity and adding more insights for better decision-making.
